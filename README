This is the readme for copysystemcalls.c

WHAT IS IT-
My program will copy an entire file to the same directory byte by byte.

COMPILE-
To compile my program you need to enter `gcc -o executable_shortcut_name copysystemcalls.c`

EXECUTE-
To run my program you need to enter `./copysystemcalls source_filename destination_filename` within a terminal. You must be in the same directory as the complied code and source file which you are copying (copysystemcalls is the name that I gave my compiled program). If you do not enter all of the three fields, attempting to execute the program will result in an error.
